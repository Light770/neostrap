This project was made to have a free librairy of css for neumorphism styling.

The syntax is based on bootstrap for the most part, some change have been made to fit some of my usecases.

Run the index.html to see what the classes may look like.

## Changes to be added in the futur:

Dark mode, nice to have and shouldn't be that hard to put in place when the general layout is finished
