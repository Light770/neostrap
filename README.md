# neostrap

This project was made to have a free librairy of css for neumorphism styling.

The syntax is based on bootstrap for the most part, some change have been made to fit some of my usecases.

Run the index.html to see what the classes may look like.

Images are missing from the file, feel free to add your own to see a more accurate representation of the styles.
